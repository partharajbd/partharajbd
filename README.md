> [!IMPORTANT]
> My **GitHub** account doesn't have contributions, because I have been using **Gitlab** for my personal projects when GitHub was not free for private projects.
> <br/>And then started using **BitBucket** to work on the agile environment with the Atlassian ecosystem (Jira, Confluence, and so on).
