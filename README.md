### Hi there 👋
# I am Partharaj Deb 🇧🇩
### Sr. Software Engineer at [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/resume/partharaj-deb)

I’ve spent over ten years building and scaling software systems across the Fintech, MedTech, EdTech, AgriTech, HRTech, and eCommerce industries around the world. My main stack is Java with Spring Boot and PHP with Laravel. Over time, my work has naturally grown beyond development into system design, DevOps, and technical product management.

I’ve cracked the Toptal screening process and worked with clients across continents, helping them streamline complex operations, modernize legacy systems, and ship products that actually deliver results. I’ve led engineering efforts, designed scalable architectures, managed AWS infrastructures, and built CI/CD pipelines that keep releases predictable and stress-free.

I also specialize in connecting systems, whether that means integrating third-party APIs, building microservices, designing event-driven architectures, or setting up message streaming with tools like Kafka or RabbitMQ. But I always aim for outcome-driven simplicity, avoiding over-engineering when a clean, straightforward design gets the job done better.

After a decade in this field, I still enjoy solving hard technical problems and shaping systems that make sense both technically and strategically. I like designing for scale, writing code that others can easily maintain, and helping teams grow into confident, independent problem-solvers.

At the core, I build products that work, systems that last, and teams that keep improving through them.
